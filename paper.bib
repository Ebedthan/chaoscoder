	abstract = {DNA sequences are fundamental for encoding genetic information. The genetic information may be understood not only from symbolic sequences but also from the hidden signals inside the sequences. The symbolic sequences need to be transformed into numerical sequences so the hidden signals can be revealed by signal processing techniques. All current transformation methods encode DNA sequences into numerical values of the same length. These representations have limitations in the applications of genomic signal compression, encryption, and steganography. We propose a novel integer chaos game representation (inter-CGR or iCGR) of DNA sequences and a lossless encoding method DNA sequences by the iCGR. In the iCGR method, a DNA sequence is represented by the iterated function of the nucleotides and their positions in the sequence. Then the DNA sequence can be uniquely encoded and recovered using three integers from iCGR. One integer is the sequence length and the other two integers represent the accumulated distributions of nucleotides in the sequence. The integer encoding scheme can compress a DNA sequence by 2 bits per nucleotide. The integer representation of DNA sequences provides a prospective tool for sequence analysis and operations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method for representing DNA sequences. It permits the representation and investigation of patterns in sequences, visually revealing previously unknown structures. Based on a technique from chaotic dynamics, the method produces a picture of a gene sequence which displays both local and global patterns. The pictures have a complex structure which varies depending on the sequence. The method is termed Chaos Game Representation (CGR). CGR raises a new set of questions about the structure of DNA sequences, and is a new tool for investigating gene structure.},

All machine learning techniques fit models to data; however, the specific methods are quite varied and can at first glance seem bewildering. In this Review, we aim to provide readers with a gentle introduction to a few key machine learning techniques, including the most recently developed and widely used techniques involving deep neural networks. We describe how different techniques may be suited to specific types of biological data, and also discuss some best practices and points to consider when one is embarking on experiments involving machine learning. Some emerging directions in machine learning methodology are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000. A MATLAB implementation of the proposed algorithm is available online at http://www.cns.nyu.edu//spl sim/lcv/ssim/.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Chaos Game Representation (CGR) is an iterative mapping technique that processes sequences of units, such as nucleotides in a DNA sequence or amino acids in a protein, in order to find the coordinates for their position in a continuous space. This distribution of positions has two properties: it is unique, and the source sequence can be recovered from the coordinates such that distance between positions measures similarity between the corresponding sequences. The possibility of using the latter property to identify succession schemes have been entirely overlooked in previous studies which raises the possibility that CGR may be upgraded from a mere representation technique to a sequence modeling tool.
RESULTS: The distribution of positions in the CGR plane were shown to be a generalization of Markov chain probability tables that accommodates non-integer orders. Therefore, Markov models are particular cases of CGR models rather than the reverse, as currently accepted. In addition, the CGR generalization has both practical (computational efficiency) and fundamental (scale independence) advantages. These results are illustrated by using Escherichia coli K-12 as a test data-set, in particular, the genes thrA, thrB and thrC of the threonine operon.},

Nevertheless, beginners and biomedical researchers often do not have enough experience to run a data mining project effectively, and therefore can follow incorrect practices, that may lead to common mistakes or over-optimistic results. With this review, we present ten quick tips to take advantage of machine learning in any computational biology context, by avoiding some common errors that we observed hundreds of times in multiple bioinformatics projects. We believe our ten suggestions can strongly help any machine learning practitioner to carry on a successful project in computational biology and related sciences.},
